Weather Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts future weather conditions (such as temperature, humidity, or rainfall) using Machine Learning models trained on historical weather data.
It includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

📌 Project Overview

Weather prediction is a key task in meteorology and data science.
In this project:

Data is cleaned and preprocessed
Patterns and trends are analyzed
Different ML models are trained
Best model is used to make predictions
The goal is to create an accurate and easy-to-use weather prediction system.
